The Spotify shuffle algorithm doesn't feel random, so I put together a script in python to track the number of times a song has played in a playlist, as well as some basic info and data about the songs. I intend on adding some analysis features in order to determine if there's any correlation to the songs Spotify's shuffling to the data that this project collects.

spotifystats-old only utilizes the csv library, but is no longer maintained or updated by me.
Otherwise, tkinter is needed to utilize the full GUI of the project (within the main spotifystats.py file).

Run the python script from the same directory that any playlist txt files are stored!
