I have noticed that the Spotify shuffle algorithm doesn't feel random. Inspired by this, I put together a script in python to track the number of times a song has played in a playlist, as well as some basic info and data about the songs. I intend on adding some analysis features to step towards an answer to my original question: is there any pattern to Spotify's shuffling algorithm?

spotifystats-old only utilizes the csv library, but is no longer maintained or updated by me.
Otherwise, tkinter is needed to utilize the full GUI of the project (within the main musicalstats.py file).

Run the python script from the same directory that any playlist txt files are stored!
