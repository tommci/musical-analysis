The spotify shuffle algorithm doesn't feel random, so I threw together a simple script in python to track the number of times a song has played in a playlist, as well as some basic info about the songs.

Run the python script from the same directory that any playlist txt files are stored!

I plan to add to this project over time. I plan to include sorting based on any stat (song length, album, global listens) at some point.
